Q1.

A Bluetooth piconet uses a special pseudo-random number generator, which picks one of the 79 available channels with equal probability at the start of each slot. The master is using the Master Delay Policy to refrain from channels where interference is high. The master has detected that all but Channel 45 are free from interference. This means that the master will have to skip a slot only if the chosen frequency for that slot happens to be 45, otherwise no skipping is necessary. What is the probability that the master will be able to transmit a 5-slot packet without skipping a single slot?







Q2. The following figure shows a snapshot of the communications that took place between the master and three slave devices in a given Bluetooth piconet. How many times the frequency was switched during this period? What was the interval between the first and last switch?







Q3. What would be the total number of non-payload bits in a Bluetooth packet if the header was encoded with 2/3 rate FEC?







Q4. You are designing a wall-mounted Bluetooth location beacon, which will periodically broadcast location related information. Each broadcast lasts for 10 ms, during which the Bluetooth device consumes 30 mW at 2 V. You are allowed to configure the broadcast frequency to save battery. How frequently the Bluetooth device should broadcast location beacons if you want a 150 mAh coin cell battery to last for 5 years?




Q5. Which Bluetooth LE channels will have less likelihood of interference with wireless

LAN?
